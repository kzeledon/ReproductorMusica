            Im going back to 505
            If it\'s a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
            In my imagination you\'re waiting, lying on your side
            With your hands between your thighs
            Stop and wait a sec
            Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling
            What did you expect?
            I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
            Or I did last time I checked
            Not shy of a spark
            A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
            Frightened by the bite though it\'s no harsher than the bark
            Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start
            I\'m going back to 505
            If it\'s a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
            In my imagination you\'re waiting, lying on your side
            With your hands between your thighs
            But I crumble completely when you cry
            It seems like once again you\'ve had to greet me with goodbye
            I\'m always just about to go and spoil a surprise
            Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
            I\'m going back to 505
            If it\'s a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
            In my imagination you\'re waiting, lying on your side
            With your hands between your thighs and a smile!

            A cloud hangs over this city by the sea,
            I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be,
            Out there and sober as a well for loneliness,
            Please do persist girl its time we met and made, a mess

            I picture your face in the back of my eyes,
            A fire in the attic a proof of the prize,
            Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly

            A cloud hangs over,
            And mutes my happiness,
            A thousand ships couldnt sail me back from distress,
            Wish you were here,
            I\'m a wounded satellite,
            I need you now put me back together make me right

            I picture your face in the back of my eyes a
            fire in the attic a proof of the prize,
            Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly
            I\'m calling your name up into the air
            Not one of the others could ever compare!
            Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly!

            Wait there is a light,
            There is a fire illuminated attic,
            Fate or something better I could care less,
            Just stay with me a while,
            Wait there is a light, there is a fire defragmenting the attic,
            Fate or something better I could care less,
            Just stay with me a while

            I picture your face in the back of my eyes a fire in the attic a proof of the prize,
            Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly,
            Im calling your name up into the air.
            Not one of the others could ever compare!
            Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly!

            I got a lot to say to you
            Yeah I got a lot to say
            I noticed your eyes are always glued to me
            Keeping them here and it makes no sense at all
            They taped over your mouth
            Scribbled out the truth with their lies
            Your little spies
            They taped over your mouth
            Scribbled out the truth with their lies
            Your little spies
            Crush, crush, crush, crush, crush (one, two, three, four)
            Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
            Just the one two of us is counting on
            That never happens, I guess I\'m dreaming again
            Let\'s be more than, this
            If you wanna play it like a game
            Come on, come on let\'s play
            \'Cause I\'d rather waste my life pretending
            Than have to forget you for one whole minute

            Rock and roll baby, don\'t you know that

            Have you got color in your cheeks\'
            Do you ever get the feeling that you can\'t shift the tide
            That sticks around like something\'s in your teeth
            And some aces up your sleeve
            I had no idea that you\'re in deep
            I dreamt about you near me every night this week
            How many secrets can you keep\'
            \'Cause there\'s this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
            When I play it on repeat
            Until I fall asleep
            Spilling drinks on my settee
            If this feeling flows both ways
            (Sad to see you go)
            Was sorta hoping that you\'d stay
            (Baby we both know)
            That the nights were mainly made for saying
            things that you can\'t say tomorrow day
            Crawlin\' back to you.
            Ever thought of calling when you\'ve had a few?
            \'Cause I always do
            Maybe I\'m too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
            Now I\'ve thought it through
            Crawling back to you
            So have you got the guts?
            Been wondering if your heart\'s still open and
            if so I wanna know what time it shuts
            Simmer down and pucker up
            I\'m sorry to interrupt it\'s just I\'m constantly
            on the cusp of trying to kiss you
            I don\'t know if you feel the same as I do
            But we could be together, if you wanted to
            If this feeling flows both ways
            (Sad to see you go)
            Was sorta hoping that you\'d stay
            (Baby we both know)
            That the nights were mainly made for saying
            things that you can\'t say tomorrow day
            Crawling back to you
            Ever thought of calling when you\'ve had a few? (calling when you\'ve had a few)
            \'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
            Maybe I\'m too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
            Now I\'ve thought it through
            Crawling back to you, (do I wanna know?)
            If this feeling flows both ways
            (Sad to see you go)

            Ever thought of calling darling?

            Lay it, lay it down, let me see your hand
            Show me what you got
            You\'re always talking, but you\'re not playing
            It doesn\'t match your face
            Gotta find my way, away from this place
            Can you take me now
            I-I want it, I want it real
            Are you afraid of me now?
            Are you afraid of me now?

            Do you feel it, do you feel it?
            Do you feel that I can see your soul?
            Do you feel it, do you feel it?
            Do you feel the beat in your heart?

            I-I want it, I want it real
            Run away with me now
            I-I want it, I want it real
            Run away with me now

            Someday\'s I\'m built of metal, I can\'t be broken
            But not when I\'m with you
            You love me real, we have it all
            Can\'t leave me now
            I love the way, you are today
            Run away with me now
            Wind in my hair, cause I don\'t care
            Baby run away with me now
            Run away with me now

            Do you feel it, do you feel it?
            Do you feel that I can see your soul?
            Do you feel it, do you feel it?
            Do you feel the beat in your heart?

            I-I want it, I want it real
            Run away with me now
            I-I want it, I want it real
            Run away with me now

            Drinking in the summer, I\'m good at running
            I beat you in the race again
            Are you afraid, when I look your way
            It\'s easiest to stay at home
            But then we taste it, we got to have it
            We have no control
            Where is the love, the kind we dream of
            The kind that makes us young
            The kind that makes us young

            Never leave me out

            Never leave me out

            You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together always
I really feel
That I\'m losing my best friend
I can\'t believe
This could be the end
It looks as though you\'re letting go
And if it\'s real
Well I don\'t want to know
Don\'t speak
I know just what you\'re saying
So please stop explaining
Don\'t tell me \'cause it hurts
Don\'t speak
I know what you\'re thinking
I don\'t need your reasons
Don\'t tell me \'cause it hurts
Our memories
Well, they can be inviting
But some are altogether
Mighty frightening
As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands
I sit and cry
Don\'t speak
I know just what you\'re saying
So please stop explaining
Don\'t tell me \'cause it hurts (no, no, no)
Don\'t speak
I know what you\'re thinking
I don\'t need your reasons
Don\'t tell me \'cause it hurts
It\'s all ending
I gotta stop pretending who we are
You and me I can see us dying, are we?
Don\'t speak
I know just what you\'re saying
So please stop explaining
Don\'t tell me \'cause it hurts (no, no, no)
Don\'t speak
I know what you\'re thinking
And I don\'t need your reasons
Don\'t tell me \'cause it hurts
Don\'t tell me \'cause it hurts!
I know what you\'re saying
So please stop explaining
Don\'t speak
Don\'t speak
Don\'t speak
Oh I know what you\'re thinking
And I don\'t need your reasons
I know you\'re good
I know you\'re good
I know you\'re real good
Oh, la la la la la la, la la la la la la
Don\'t, don\'t, uh-huh hush, hush darlin\'
Hush, hush darlin\' hush, hush
Don\'t tell me tell me \'cause it hurts
Hush, hush darlin\' hush, hush darlin\'
Hush, hush don\'t tell me tell me \'cause it hurts

            Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning (uh)
The force of love beginning
We\'ve come too far to give up who we are

She\'s up all night \'til the sun

            I can hold my breath
I can bite my tongue
I can stay awake for days
If that’s what you want
Be your number one
I can fake a smile
I can force a laugh
I can dance and play the part
If that’s what you ask
Give you all I am
I can do it
I can do it
I can do it
But I’m only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I’m only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
\'Cause I’m only human, yeah
I can turn it on
Be a good machine
I can hold the weight of worlds
If that’s what you need
Be your everything
I can do it
I can do it
I\'ll get through it
But I’m only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I’m only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
\'Cause I’m only human, yeah
I’m only human
I’m only human
Just a little human
I can take so much
Until I’ve had enough
‘Cause I’m only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I’m only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
‘Cause I’m only human, yeah

            When these pillars get pulled down
It will be you who wears the crown
And I\'ll owe everything to you
How much pain has quaked your soul?
How much love would make you whole?
You\'re my guiding lightning strike
I can\'t find the words to say
They\'re overdue
I\'ve traveled half the world to say
I belong to you
And she attacks me like a Leo
When my heart is split like Rio
And I assure you my debts are real
I can\'t find the words to say
When I\'m confused
I traveled half the world to say
You are my muse
I can\'t find the words to say
They\'re overdue
I\'ve traveled half the world to say
I belong to you

            Down to you
You\'re pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don\'t know what I
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
I\'m saying something that I should have never thought
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
I\'m saying something that I should have never thought of you, of you
You\'re pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don\'t know what I want
No I don\'t know what I want
You got it, you got it
Some kind of magic
Hypnotic, hypnotic
You\'re leaving me breathless
I hate this, I hate this
You\'re not the one I believe in
With God as my witness
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
I\'m saying something that I should have never thought
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
I\'m saying something that I should have never thought of you,
You\'re pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don\'t know what I want
No I don\'t know what I want
Don\'t know what I want
But I know it\'s not you
Keep pushing and pulling me down
But I know in my heart it\'s not you
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
I\'m saying something that I should have never thought
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
I\'m saying something that I should have never thought of you
I knew, I know in my heart it\'s not you
I knew, but now I know what I want, I want, I want
Oh no, I should have never thought

            I took a walk around the world to
Ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere
In the sands of time
I watched the world float to the dark
Side of the moon
I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah
I watched the world float to the
Dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something
To do with you
I really don\'t mind what happens now and then
As long as you\'ll be my friend at the end
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I\'m alive and well, will you be
There holding my hand
I\'ll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I
Never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head, if
Not for me then you\'d be dead
I picked you up and put you back
On solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I\'m alive and well, will you be
There holding my hand
I\'ll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
Oh whoa whoa
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I\'m alive and well, will you be
There holding my hand
I\'ll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
If I go crazy then will you still

           Fatal, this attraction, yeah we might just end up crashin\'
But I\'m ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I\'m far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You\'re the only thing I know
And I don\'t wanna let this go
Close to you are I feel, feel like I\'m at home
Can\'t wait \'til we\'re alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin\' nothin\' back
Like it\'s our last dance
Like it\'s our last dance
Like it\'s our last dance
My eyes wide open, fallin\' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin\' like a river in my head
Crying, you ain\'t with me and it\'s floodin\' the whole city
While my soul\'s burnin\' like a cigarette
You\'re the only thing I know
And I don\'t wanna let this go
Close to you are I feel, feel like I\'m at home
Can\'t wait \'til we\'re alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin\' nothin\' back
Like it\'s our last dance
Like it\'s our last dance
Like it\'s our last dance
Like it\'s our last dance
Like it\'s our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long, I\'m hurtin\'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long, I\'m hurtin\'
Was it worth it?
Like it\'s our last dance
Like it\'s our last dance
Like it\'s our last dance
I\'ll fall in love
I\'ll fall in love
I\'ll fall in love
I\'ll fall in love
I\'ll fall in love

            I dreamed I was missing
You were so scared
But no one would listen
Cause no one else cared
After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I\'m done here?
So, if you\'re asking me, I want you to know
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I\'ve done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don\'t resent me
And when you\'re feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Don\'t be afraid
I\'ve taken my beating
I\'ve shared what I\'ve made
I\'m strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I\'ve never been perfect
But neither have you
So, if you\'re asking me, I want you to know
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I\'ve done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don\'t resent me
And when you\'re feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Forgetting
All the hurt inside you\'ve learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can\'t be who you are
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I\'ve done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don\'t resent me
And when you\'re feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Forgetting
All the hurt inside you\'ve learned to hide so well
Pretending

I can\'t be who you are
I can\'t be who you are

            Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It\'s not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn\'t have to say that you love me
\'Cause I\'d already know
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn\'t make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words
La di da, da di da, di dai dai da
Now I\'ve tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don\'t ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn\'t have to say that you love me
\'Cause I\'d already know
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn\'t make things new
Just by saying I love you
La di da, da di da, di dai dai da
More than words
La di da, da di da, di dai dai da
More than words
La di da, da di da
La di da, da di da, more than words
La di da, da di da, di dai dai da
La di da, da di da, more than words (oh uh uh uh)
More than words

           Face stained in the ceiling
Why does it keep saying,
I don\'t have to see you right now
I don\'t have to see you right now
Digging like you can bury
Something that cannot die
We could wash the dirt off our hands now
Keep it from living underground
Lazy summer goddess
You can tell our whole empire
I don\'t have to see you right now
I don\'t have to see you right now
I don\'t have to see you right now
I don\'t have to see you right now
I don\'t have to see you right now

Fuck that shit
Still on this mothafuckin\' record
I\'ma play this mothafucka for y\'all
Ayy, y\'all get some more drinks goin\' on, I\'ll sound a whole lot better
Listen
Seein\' you got ritualistic
Cleansin\' my soul of addiction for now
\'Cause I\'m fallin\' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won\'t mention for now
\'Cause we\'re fallin\' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin\' up on my old ways
I can\'t blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin\' up on my old ways
I can\'t blame you, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin\' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
\'Cause we\'re fallin\' apart
Leavin\'
You\'re just doing that to get even
Don\'t pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin\' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin\' up on my old ways
I can\'t blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin\' up on my old ways
I can\'t blame you, no, no

            What I want from you is empty your head
Well they say be true, don\'t stain your bed
Well we do what we need to be free
And it leans on me just like a rootless tree
What I want from us is empty our minds
Well we fake a fuss and fracture the times
We go blind when we\'ve needed to see
And this leans on me just like a rootless
So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
And all we\'ve been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It\'s nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Then hate me so good that you can let me out, let me out, let me out
Of this hell when you\'re around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you\'re around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
What I want from this is learn to let go
No not of you, of all that\'s been told
But killers reinvent and believe
And this leans on me just like a rootless
So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
And all we\'ve been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It\'s nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Then hate me so good that you can let me out, let me out, let me out
Of this hell when you\'re around
Let me out, let me out, let me out

Hell when you\'re around
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out

            Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we\'ll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we\'ll one day swallow whole
Fade out again
Fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love

            I was so high, I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice \'cause I won\'t say goodbye anymore, woah, woah, woah
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice \'cause I won\'t say goodbye anymore woah, woah, woah
I\'ll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything is alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
\'Cause I know that\'s what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice \'cause I won\'t say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice \'cause I won\'t say goodbye anymore

            The glove compartment is inaccurately named
And everybody knows it
So I\'m proposing a swift orderly change
\'Cause behind its door, there\'s nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all I find are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life
I was searching for some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When I stumbled upon pictures I tried to forget
And that\'s how this idea was drilled into my head
\'Cause it\'s too important to stay the way it\'s been
There\'s no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it\'s gone, it\'s like it wasn\'t there at all
And here I rest where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night
There\'s no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it\'s gone, it\'s like it wasn\'t there at all
And here I rest where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night, up all night
When I\'m lying awake at night
